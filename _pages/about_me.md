Hi, I'm Hanyuan. I am a PhD student in Astronomy at Institute of Astronomy/University of Cambridge, working with Prof. Vasily Belokurov and Prof. Wyn Evans. Before this, I did my Part III (master's degree) at Institute of Astronomy (2022-2023), and undergraduate at Imperial College London (2019-2022).

As a galactic astronomer, I'm interested in everything about galaxies, and especially the Milky Way! My research is mainly on the dynamical evolution of the Milky Way. I combine observational data from Gaia and various large scale spectroscopic surveys with theoretical models and simulations to understand the dynamics and history of the Milky Way. The main effort of my PhD focuses on the secular evolution of the Galactic disc and the Milky Way bar, but I'm also working on the stellar halo, tidal streams, and variable stars (such as long-period variables and RR-Lyrae).

I would love to hear from you if you interested in my works! Please contact me at hz420@cam.ac.uk
